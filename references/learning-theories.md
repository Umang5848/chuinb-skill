## 1. Feynman Technique (费曼学习法)

### Origin

Named after Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman, known for his ability to explain complex quantum physics concepts in simple, accessible terms.

### The Four Steps

### Application in Industry Mastery

When generating content:

1. **One-sentence summary** — Force distillation of the industry's essence into one clear sentence
2. **Analogy-rich explanations** — Connect every new concept to something the user already understands
3. **Jargon translation** — Every technical term gets a plain-language explanation
4. **"Explain like I'm 12" test** — If a concept can't be simplified, it's not understood well enough

### Key Phrases to Use

- "简单来说就是..."
- "你可以把它想象成..."
- "就像你熟悉的 [analogy]..."
- "本质上，这就是..."

## 2. First Principles Thinking (第一性原理)

### Origin

Ancient Greek philosophy (Aristotle), popularized in modern context by Elon Musk for innovation and problem-solving.

### Definition

> "First principles thinking is the act of boiling a process down to the fundamental parts that you know are true and building up from there."
> — Elon Musk

### The Process

│  "So we should too"                    ↓                   │
│                                 "What can we build         │

│                                                            │
│  Results: Incremental           Results: Breakthrough      │
│           improvements                   innovation        │
│                                                            │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### The Five Whys Technique

A practical tool for reaching first principles:

1. State the problem/concept
2. Ask "Why?" and answer
3. Ask "Why?" to that answer
4. Repeat until you hit fundamental truths
5. Build understanding from those truths

### Application in Industry Mastery

When analyzing an industry:

1. **Identify the core problem** — What fundamental human need does this industry serve?
2. **Map the value chain** — How does value flow from creation to consumption?
3. **Find the constraints** — What physical, economic, or regulatory limits define the industry?
4. **Question assumptions** — Which "industry truths" are actually just conventions?

### Key Questions to Ask

- "这个行业存在的根本原因是什么？"
- "它解决了人类的什么基本需求？"
- "如果从零开始，最优解是什么？"
- "哪些是真正的约束，哪些只是习惯？"

## 3. Pareto Principle / 80/20 Rule (帕累托法则)

### Origin

Named after Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto, who observed that 80% of Italy's land was owned by 20% of the population.

### Core Insight

> In most systems, roughly 80% of effects come from 20% of causes.

### Applications Across Domains

| Domain | 80/20 Manifestation |
|--------|---------------------|
| Business | 80% of revenue from 20% of customers |
| Software | 80% of bugs in 20% of code |
| Learning | 80% of practical value from 20% of content |
| Language | 80% of communication uses 20% of words |

### Application in Industry Mastery

When curating content:

1. **Identify the vital few** — What 20% of knowledge enables 80% of understanding?
2. **Prioritize ruthlessly** — Not everything is equally important; focus on leverage points
3. **Jargon selection** — Which 10-15 terms will cover 80% of conversations?
4. **Case selection** — Which 2-3 cases exemplify the industry's dynamics?

### The "Insider Minimum" Concept

For any industry, there exists a "minimum viable knowledge set" that allows one to:
- Understand 80% of industry conversations
- Ask intelligent questions
- Avoid obvious mistakes
- Appear competent to insiders

**This is the target output of Industry Mastery.**

### Practical Filters

When researching, prioritize information that is:

| Priority | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| High | Mentioned repeatedly across sources |
| High | Referenced by industry insiders |
| High | Essential for understanding the value chain |
| Medium | Interesting but not core |
| Low | Highly specialized or niche |
| Skip | Outdated or rarely referenced |

## Combining the Three Pillars

The three methodologies work together:

│           ↓                                                     │
│  FEYNMAN TECHNIQUE                                              │
│  "How do I explain this simply?"                                │
│           ↓                                                     │
│  OUTPUT: Clear, concise, high-impact learning content           │
│                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Workflow Integration

1. **Research Phase** — Use 80/20 to filter and prioritize
2. **Analysis Phase** — Use First Principles to find core truths
3. **Presentation Phase** — Use Feynman to make it accessible
